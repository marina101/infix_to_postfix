The program Calculator converts an arithmetic expression from infix notation to postfix notation using stacks and queues, and then evaluates the result.

Special Instructions: 

When the program asks for input, please give it the expression you wish on that same line, then press return. Don’t leave any blank spaces inside the expression that you are inputting.

Each token in your math expression must be either a binary arithmetic operator, an integer operand, or a left or right parenthesis.

The input infix expression must consist of only single digit operands, the following operators (+,-,*,/,%), and a left or right parenthesis. The parentheses must be balanced and properly nested.

Error catching:
-the program can detect if a character is entered into the expression that is not an integer, a binary operator, or a left or right parenthesis, and will throw an error
-the program can detect if the parentheses are not balanced or properly nested, and will throw an error

Important:
The main method must always be run within a try block, and needs to have a catch block
